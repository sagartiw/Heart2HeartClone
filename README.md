## Hey! Quick note about the Firebase config ðŸ”¥

You'll need to add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to get firebase working. Here's how:

1. go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. click on the Heart2Heart app
3. In the top left where it says project overview, there should be a little gear icon.
4. Click that then click project settings
5. Scroll down to where it says 'Your Apps' and click on Heart 2 Heart
6. click the download GoogleService-Info.plist file:

8. Drop it right into the root of the Xcode project (next to the inner Heart2Heart folder)

Then you should be off to the races!
